# Movie Recommendation Application

This project implements a movie recommendation application on the Google Cloud platform. Users input their movie preferences and receive recommendations based on those preferences.

## Components
- **Backend (Flask)**: Trains a movie recommender system using BigQuery ML, implements autocomplete with Elasticsearch, and finds similar users to provide movie recommendations.
- **Frontend (Streamlit)**: Provides a user-friendly interface with a movie title search bar and displays recommended movies.

## Issues
The recommendation functionalities were not successfully implemented in this version of the project.
